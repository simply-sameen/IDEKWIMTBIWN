## I Don't Even Know Why I Made This, But It Works Nonetheless

IDEKWIMTBIWN v1.4 started as a calculator program for my Python Add-On course provided by my college. However, knowing that I was too good for it, I kept adding functions until I created this unwanted pile of code-junk. 

This program has a binary-encoded account system used to log in to the program, which is still under development. I plan to add more features down the line, making it easily extendible with lots of blanks to be filled.
